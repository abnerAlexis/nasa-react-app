# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Create a React Project with Vite
1. Before opening vscode, in terminal, type;  
`npm create vite@latest nasa-react-app` 

2. Open the vscode and open the newly created folder
3. Open the ide's terminal and type  
    `npm install'  to install all the packages specified within package.json.
4. Then type  
    `npm run dev` to run the code on browser.
5. Delete App.css file and delete the line making a call of App.css inside the App.jsx file. This will clear out all the styles in App.jsx rendering.
6. Leave only the skeleton form inside App.jsx
